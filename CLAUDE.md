# Classifile Project Context

## In a new session before making changes

Load the `Readme.md` into context so you understand the project

## While making changes

Replace unnecessarily verbose code with more terse statements.
Remove unnecessary comments and use better variable naming where needed.
For all changes, write comprehensive tests

## After Making Changes

Only if issues were encountered which required user interaction to correct, then update the .claude.md with something 
that fixes any problems encountered automatically in the future.
